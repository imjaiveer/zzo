##### **25.3** g of sodium carbonate Na2â€‹CO3â€‹ is dissolved in enough water to make **250** mL of solution .If sodium carbonate dissociates completely molar concentration of sodium ions Na+ and carbonate ions are respectively (molar mass of Na2â€‹CO3â€‹=106gmolâˆ’1 )?

##### _Number of moles of Na2â€‹CO3â€‹=10625.3â€‹=0.239 molesMolarity of solution= 0.250.239â€‹=0.956mol/litreNa2â€‹CO3â€‹âŸ¶2Na++CO32âˆ’â€‹âˆ´ Concentration of CO32âˆ’â€‹=0.956MConcentration of Na+=2Ã—0.956=1.912M_
